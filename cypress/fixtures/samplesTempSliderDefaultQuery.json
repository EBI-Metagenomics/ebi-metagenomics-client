The sample material (saline water, including plankton was collected at a depth of 646-655 m, targeting a mesopelagic zone in the marine biome. The sample was size-fractionated (0.22-3 micrometres), and stored in liquid nitrogen for later detection of prokaryote nucleic acid sequences by pyrosequencing methods, and for later metagenomics analysis. This sample has replicate sample(s): TARA_B100001106."

The sample material (saline water, including plankton was collected at a depth of 3-7 m, targeting a surface water layer in the marine biome. The sample was size-fractionated (0.22-3 micrometres), and stored in liquid nitrogen for later detection of prokaryote nucleic acid sequences by pyrosequencing methods, and for later metagenomics analysis.
