The latter samples were collected on board the RV Nereis II (Observatoire Oceanologique de Banyuls), using a high volume well pump, in the context of the EMOSE (2017) Inter-Comparison of Marine Plankton Metagenome Analysis Methods. The sampling event (EMOSE_201705300746Z_DAY1_EVENT-PUMP) occurred at position latitudeN=42.486817 and longitudeE=003.168633, on date/time=2017-05-30T07:46Z00, at a depth of 3 m. The sample material was collected in the marine biome targeting a [SRF] surface water layer. The sample material was size-fractionated and prepared back in the lab using protocol [SEQ-(2.5L-on-sterivex)_W>0.22] for later detection and identification of biological and molecular entities (nucleotides) by sequencing (SEQ) methods. The pooled samples were extracted separately and parts of the DNA from each replicate (100 ng each) are pooled (R01.1-R01.4) before sequencing. This sample may be used for example in biodiversity and metagenomics studies of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This sample has replicate sample(s): EMOSE_N020000421,EMOSE_N020000414"
