          "There is an increasing interest in the development of biological routes for lignin depolymerization and valorization. Studies have been performed to elucidate the enzymatic routes and microorganism involved in lignin conversion. Considering that the vast majority of microorganisms are not likely to be cultivated in an isolated form, metagenomic approaches display great potential to gain further access to microorganisms, genes and metabolic pathways linked to lignin breakdown and upgrading into high value chemicals. The present work focused on the development of a lignin-degrading specialized community (CLig) and the application of a combination of metagenomics approaches, including comprehensive taxonomic characterization and binning-assembly for reconstruction of microbial genomes. All these efforts provide basis to portray the major bacterial pathways involved in lignin degradation and aromatic compounds conversion. From the analysis of massive DNA sequencing data, several microorganisms and enzymes linked to the metabolic pathways of interest were identified, thus constituting a promising resource of biological information for lignin valorization. Along with isolation and genome sequencing of lignolytic bacterial strain of potential biotechnological interest, pathways for lignin valorization was validated based on vanillin production from ferulic acid using feruloyl-CoA synthetase (fcs) and enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase (ech)."

          "All cultivated ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) within the Nitrososphaera cluster (former soil group 1.1b) are neutrophilic. Molecular survey also indicates broad existence of Nitrososphaera-like phylotype in acid soil, but its ecological role is poorly understood. In this study, we present molecular evidences for chemolithoautotrophic growth of the Nitrososphaera-like AOA in an acid soil with pH 4.92 using DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP). Soil microcosm incubations demonstrated that nitrification was stimulated by urea fertilization and accompanied by significant increase in abundance of AOA rather than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Real-time PCR analysis of amoA genes as a function of buoyant density of DNA gradient following ultracentrification of the total DNA extracted from SIP microcosms indicated substantial growth of soil AOA during nitrification. Pyrosequencing of the total 16S rRNA genes in the heavy DNA fractions suggested that archaeal and nitrite-oxidizing bacterial communities were labeled to a much greater extent than soil AOB. Acetylene inhibition further showed that 13CO2 assimilation by nitrifying communities depended solely on ammonia oxidation activity, suggesting chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle. Sequencing analysis of both amoA and 16S rRNA genes revealed that the 13C-labeled AOA were phylogenetically closely related to neutrophilic strains Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76 and JG1 within the Nitrososphaera cluster. Our results provide strong evidence for the adaptative growth of Nitrososphaera-like AOA in acid soil, suggesting a greater metabolic versatility of soil AOA than previously appreciated."

Chemical engineers at Texas A&M use three fermentation screens to evaluate and model community performance at different scales, times, substrate concentrations, and product concentrations. To date, these screens have been used sequentially to optimize different features of the process while the inoculum has undergone selective pressure from storage conditions. We used four fresh, environmentally distinct, previously characterized sediment sources collected from Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge to simultaneously inoculate the three screens. We sequenced the communities in each screen to compare the communities that establish across the manipulated parameters."

          "Amino acids are important monomers that are ubiquitously present in anaerobic environments after protein hydrolysis. Anaerobic digester sludge from two sources was used to inoculate batch cultures, which were fed with twenty individual amino acids. Five successive enrichments were performed with 10% v/v transfer. 16S rRNA and rRNA gene were extracted and amplified from enrichment cultures. Amplicons were sequenced using Illumina Miseq platform. Distinct community structures were observed between the first enrichment and later enrichments. Such trajectory of community evolution indicated enrichment of specific amino acids degraders that were not abundant in the early enrichments. Based on known knowledge of fermenters, syntrophs, and methanogens, four types of communities were observed."

          "Insects are frequently associated with bacteria that can have significant ecological and evolutionary impacts on their hosts. Much progress has been made to unravel the diversity and effects of obligate and facultative endosymbionts. Nevertheless, few studies have examined the influence of environmental factors to microbiome composition of aphids. The current work assessed the diversity of bacterial communities of five cereal aphid species collected across Morocco and covering a wide range of environmental conditions. Deep 16S rRNA sequencing enabled us to identify 17 bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU). Facultative endosymbionts were totally absent in D. noxia, R. maïdis and R. padi, whereas a high relative prevalence of R. insecticola and S. symbiotica was observed in S. avenae and S. maydis, respectively. In addition to these symbiotic partners, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Pantoea, Erwinia and Staphyloccocus were also identified in the aphid species R. padi, R. maïdis and S. avenae, suggesting that the aphid microbiome is not limited to the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria. Beside the significant association between host species and bacterial communities, a significant inverse correlation was also found between altitude and α-diversity."

          "Microbial communities in biofilms have been suggested to mediate a wide spectrum of ecological functions. However, the underlying mechanism of most of the mediations is still unresolved mainly because of the uncertainty in characterizing members in the communities using existing 16S rRNA gene-based molecular methods. In this study, a newly developed method – barcoded 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing – was employed to provide a detailed characterization of the bacterial communities in intertidal and subtidal marine biofilms developed in two seasons. This method has high sensitivity to detect low-abundance taxa and is able to generate a large amount of highly reliable data in a very short period of time. Our results revealed highly diverse biofilm bacterial communities varied with season and tidal level. Over 6,000 OTUs with species estimates of up to 15,000 were recovered in a biofilm sample, which is by far the highest record in sub-tropical marine biofilms and is much greater than biofilms developed in certain natural habitats. Nineteen phyla were found in the biofilm samples, for which Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum dominating the intertidal and subtidal biofilms, respectively. Apart from these two phyla, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were found to be the major groups recovered in both intertidal and subtidal biofilms, yet their relative abundance varied among samples. Full-length 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed for the 4 biofilm samples and showed similar results with pyrosequencing. The relationship of bacterial community and settlement of larvae of a marine invertebrate is discussed."

For this purpose, two soil ecosystems with distinct ecophysiological characteristics were selected, and thorough spatio-seasonal sampling was undertaken. Total DNA was extracted from 48 soil samples, and PCR amplification was performed with both 16S (V3-V4) region- and ITS2-specific universal primers for the analysis of bacterial and fungal diversity, respectively. High-throughput amplicon sequencing was performed with the Illumina MiSeq technology."
