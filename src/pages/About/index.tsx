      <h2>The MGnify resource</h2>
      <p>
        Microbiome research involves the study of all genomes present within a
        specific environment. The approach can provide unique insights into the
        complex processes performed by environmental micro-organisms and their
        relationship to their surroundings, to each other, and, in some cases,
        to their host.
      </p>
      <p>
        MGnify offers an automated pipeline for the analysis and archiving of
        microbiome data to help determine the taxonomic diversity and functional
        & metabolic potential of environmental samples. Users can submit their
        own data for analysis or freely browse all of the analysed public
        datasets held within the repository. In addition, users can request
        analysis of any appropriate dataset within the European Nucleotide
        Archive (ENA). User-submitted or ENA-derived datasets can also be
        assembled on request, prior to analysis.
