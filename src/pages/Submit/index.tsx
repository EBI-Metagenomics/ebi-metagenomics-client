      <p>
        We provide a free service for submission of raw metagenomics sequence
        data and associated metadata to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)
        and analysis by MGnify.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have data that you wish to have analysed, you need an ENA
        submitter account that has been registered with the MGnify. This allows
        us to track your submitted data and ensures that we have consent to
        access it for analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a valid ENA submitter account, you can submit your data directly
        using the{' '}
        <ExtLink href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home">
          ENA Webin tool
        </ExtLink>
        , which will help you describe your metadata and upload your sequence
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your reads are uploaded to ENA, navigate to the home page, click
        &apos;Submit and/or Request&apos; and complete the form to request an
        analysis with MGnify. You will receive an email once the analysis starts
        and another when the analysis of all samples is complete (

          type="button"
          className="vf-button vf-button--link mg-button-as-link"

        >
          View figure for more details
        </button>{' '}
        of the submission and analysis process). The analysis time is dependent
        on the number of samples submitted and requests by other submitters at
        the time. If your samples are private, you will need to log in to MGnify
        to be able to view the results of the analysis.

            Note, if you plan to submit pre-publication data for analysis, which

            the data, as well as the analysis results, will remain confidential

            also be providing consent to MGnify to submit these assemblies to
            your ENA study on your behalf. MGnify will not change any metadata
            or data you have already submitted but may need to perform updates
            to submissions performed by their team in exceptional circumstances.
