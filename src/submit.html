            <h2>Submit data</h2>
            <p>
                We provide a free service for submission of raw metagenomics sequence data and associated metadata to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and analysis by MGnify.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have data that you wish to have analysed, you need an ENA submitter account that has been registered with the MGnify. This allows us to track your submitted data and ensures that we have consent to access it for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a valid ENA submitter account, you can submit your data directly using the <a class="ext"
                href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home">ENA Webin tool</a>, which will help you describe your metadata and upload your sequence data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your reads are uploaded to ENA, navigate to the home page, click 'Submit and/or Request' and complete the form to request an analysis with MGnify. You will receive an email once the analysis starts and another when the analysis of all samples is complete (<a data-open="submissionModal" title="" aria-describedby="qtip-23">view figure for more details</a> of the submission and analysis process). The analysis time is dependent on the number of samples submitted and requests by other submitters at the time. If your samples are private, you will need to log in to MGnify to be able to view the results of the analysis.

                <p>
                    Note, if you plan to submit pre-publication data for analysis, which is to be held as confidential, we need consent to access your data in accordance with ENAâ€™s policies. By keeping this box checked, you consent to the MGnify team analysing your private data. Note that the data, as well as the analysis results, will remain confidential until the release date you specify when submitting your sequencing study. If you are also requesting assembly of your data, you will also be providing consent to MGnify to submit these assemblies to your ENA study on your behalf. MGnify will not change any metadata or data you have already submitted but may need to perform updates to submissions performed by their team in exceptional circumstances. You also confirm that the data submitted through this account is NOT sensitive, restricted-access or human-identifiable.
