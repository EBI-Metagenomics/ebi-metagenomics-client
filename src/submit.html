            <h2>Submit data</h2>
            <p>We provide a free service for submission of raw metagenomics sequence data and associated metadata to the
                European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and analysis by MGnify.</p>
            <p>If you have data that you wish to have analysed, you need an ENA submitter account that has been
                registered with the MGnify. This allows us to track your submitted data and ensures that we have
                consent to access it for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>With a valid ENA submitter account, you can submit your data directly using the <a class="ext"
                                                                                                  href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home">ENA
                Webin tool</a>, which will help you describe your metadata and upload your sequence data.</p>
            <p>Once your reads are uploaded to the ENA, the MGnify team will access them and perform the
                analysis, which is done in several steps. You will receive an email once the analysis starts and another
                when the
                analysis of all samples is complete (<a data-open="submissionModal" title="" aria-describedby="qtip-23">view
                    figure for more details</a> of the submission and analysis process). The analysis time is dependent
                on the
                number of samples submitted and requests
                by other submitters at the time. If your samples are private, you will need to log in to the EBI
                Metagenomics
                homepage to be able to view the results of the analysis.

                    Note, if you plan to
                    submit pre-publication data for analysis, which is to be held as confidential, we need consent to access
                    your data in accordance with ENAâ€™s policies. By keeping this box checked, you consent to the EBI
                    Metagenomics team analysing your private data. Note that the data, as well as the analysis results, will
                    remain confidential until the release date you specify when submitting your sequencing study. You also
                    confirm that the data submitted through this account is NOT sensitive, restricted-access or
                    human-identifiable.
