Wet tropical forest soils are some of the most productive and diverse terrestrial ecosystems on earth. These soils are characterized by high iron concentrations and regular fluctuations between oxic and anoxic conditions on a scale of days to weeks.

We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice.  Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008.  This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2 GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB).  These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) publicSamples.  In addition, the August publicSamples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals.  Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level. Analysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn.  First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness.  Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer.  Fourth, despite the diversity of these communities, night and day publicSamples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues.  When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between publicSamples across seasons.  This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future. In summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site.  The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should be focused on finding deterministic patterns in even the most complex microbial communities. The Western Channel Observatory maintains more than 100 years of continual environmental monitoring, including oceanographic and biological measures. At PML we are committed to developing this outstanding time series to include the most up to date techniques available.

The phylogenetic composition of the prokaryotic community was assessed by evaluation of a pyrosequencing-derived data set and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes.

The comparison between the two approaches revealed a bias in the fosmid libraries against low GC DNA and specifically against the two most dominant members of the community, Candidatus Pelagibacter and Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris, thus unexpectedly providing a feasible method to obtain large genomic fragments from other less prevalent members of this community. This study is the first to be carried out at this sequencing depth (ca. 600 Mbp combining direct and fosmid sequencing) at any DCM. Our results indicate a microbial community massively dominated by the high-light adapted P. marinus subsp. pastoris, Synechococcus sp. and the heterotroph Candidatus Pelagibacter.

To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn’s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased). \nThe central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype. \nThe ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms. \nPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn’s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn’s disease.

Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient.

Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome.

The microbiota  colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root), and the endophytic compartment (within the root), contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration, and phytoremediation1,2,3. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system4,5, suggesting finely-tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. We pyrosequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene of >600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophyte compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are (i) sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and (ii) sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils, and in rhizosphere and endophyte compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophyte compartments from either soil feature overlapping low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched for Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stages and genotypes.

Here we report the effect of the dietary additives: linseed oil and nitrate on methane emissions, rumen fermentation, and the rumen microbiome in two experiments from New Zealand (Dairy 1) and the UK (Dairy 2). Dairy 1 was a randomized block design with 18 multiparous lactating cows. Dairy 2 was a complete replicated 3 x 3 Latin Square using 6 rumen cannulated, lactating dairy cows. Treatments consisted of a control total mixed ration (TMR), supplementation with linseed oil (4% of feed DM) and supplementation with nitrate (2% of feed DM) in both experiments. Methane emissions were measured in open circuit respiration chambers and rumen samples were analyzed for rumen fermentation parameters and microbial population structure using qPCR and next generation sequencing (NGS). Supplementation with nitrate, but not linseed oil, decreased methane yield (g/kg DMI; P<0.02) and increased hydrogen (P<0.03) emissions in both experiments. Furthermore, the effect of nitrate on gaseous emissions was accompanied by an increased rumen acetate to propionate ratio and consistent changes in the rumen microbial populations including a decreased abundance of the main genus Prevotella and a decrease in archaeal mcrA (log10 copies/ g rumen DM content).

We identified prokaryotic and fungal populations able to utilize these sources by using DNA-stable isotope probing coupled with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ribosomal markers. A high initial 13CO2 pulse indicated that 13C-labelled microbial and plant material were consumed. The 13C-enriched DNA results indicated that betaproteobacterial taxa affiliated to the families Oxalobacteraceae and Comamonadaceae were important players in C utilization from different sources and present in all environments. In contrast, different fungal taxa played different roles in C degradation depending on the soil environment.

Here, we reevaluated the factors affecting changes in microbial communities at volcanic CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea based on a comprehensive characterization of the conditions in the sediment. Microbial community composition was assessed using molecular fingerprinting and amplicon sequencing. pH was among the factors significantly, yet not mainly, explaining changes in microbial community composition. In-situ microprofiles and trace element concentrations further showed a variation in the strength of the hydrothermal signature of the sediment at similar pH allowing the identification of sites which may better represent future OA than others. At these sites, changes in the microbial community may have implications for element cycling in the sediment.

In contrast, the dominant phyla in seawater were Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (89.3% of all classifiable reads), whereas sediments were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (85%). We found significantly higher frequencies of transcription and translation termination factors in sediments and seawater, respectively, than in marine sponge microbial metagenomes. Moreover, higher abundances of motility and chemotaxis gene reads were found in the former microhabitats in comparison with the marine sponge microbiome, where a conspicuously higher frequency of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs), accompanied by much lower viral abundance, was otherwise observed. These results suggest a highly distinct microbiome inhabiting Spongia sp., both in terms of taxonomy and function, characterized by the prevalence of k-strategy prokaryotes which collectively possess a sophisticated, early-branched viral defence system.','ERP012972','Microbial metagenome sequencing from marine sponges (Spongia sp.), seawater and sediments','FINISHED','SUBMITTED','miguelramos22@gmail.com','Miguel Ramos','2016-04-01 00:05:05.000000','Webin-41873','2015/11/ERP012972','2015-10-30 00:00:00.000000','PRJEB11585',481),(564,'IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON',NULL,1,NULL,'NeoM','ERP012953','NeoM','FINISHED','SUBMITTED','k.sim@imperial.ac.uk','Kathleen Sim','2016-02-03 10:02:09.000000','Webin-41943','2015/11/ERP012953','2015-10-29 00:00:00.000000','PRJEB11554',361),(573,'UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK',NULL,1,NULL,'The final aim of this study is to identify different soil environments potentially rich in novel natural compounds correlating microbial community diversity and biosynthetic genes for polyketide synthesis.

Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.

Given the important role of soil microbial communities in nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystem, the effects of nitrogen and water addition and their interaction on soil microbial communities increased our attention.

Transient treatment with rapamycin is also associated with a remodelling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine.

This skin disease can affect the entire body surface, but primarily the lower extremities, with symptoms varying from nodules to ulcers. Secondary bacterial infections in open BU lesions are the main cause of pain, delayed healing and systemic illness, resulting in prolonged hospital stay. Thus understanding the diversity of bacteria in these open lesions is important for proper treatment. The normal skin flora is known to protect the host through commensal relationships, however, certain factors such as ulceration can shift the skin flora from being primarily commensal to potentially pathogenic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the skin bacteria from BU ulcers, non-BU ulcers, and similar locations on the skin of healthy individuals. Results: Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions, 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples, and compared these using a data analysis pipeline. Our results showed a lower bacterial diversity in both the BU and non-BU lesions compared to the healthy skin. However, no significant differences were found between BU and non-BU lesions. The BU lesions were characterized by an increase of Bacteroidetes compared to the non-BU wounds, which contained more (Gamma)Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the BU lesions also contained significantly more obligate anaerobes.

With this molecular-based study, we were also able to detect bacteria, which were missed by culture-based methods in previous BU studies.Conclusions: Our study suggests that BU leads to changes in the bacterial community within the lesions. These changes are potentially detrimental and may cause a delay in the healing process.

The root, trunk, one-year-old cane and the soil hosted distinct microbiota, which differed according to spring, summer, and autumn.

The seasons additionally affected the microbiota in the trunks with and without a crown gall differently. A. vitis, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacteriaceae sp. were the most abundant sequences in crown galls at each season. In contrast, in healthy trunks (=non-galled) the microbial composition changed from season to season. Altogether, twenty-two operational taxonomic units, representing bacterial species, were significantly enriched in crown galls and only three in healthy trunks.

However, several key questions remain unanswered, among which is the impact of climate zones on the plant-associated microbiota. Importantly, plant-bacterial interactions in wild plants and in arcto-alpine biomes have not been well studied as compared to those in tropical and temperate biomes. We hypothesized that the bacterial communities associated with pioneer plants in the former regions have major roles in plant health support, and this would be reflected in the formation of climate and host plant specific endophytic communities. We also hypothesized that these endophytes would have a tight association with their respective host plants. To examine the drivers of the plant-associated bacterial communities, we compared the latter in the perennial plants Oxyria digyna and Saxifraga oppositifolia - naturally growing in three arcto-alpine regions [Mayrhofen, Austria - alpine, Kilpisj?rvi, Finland - low Arctic and Ny-?lesund, Svalbard -highArctic] - with those in the corresponding bulk soils. As expected, the bulk soil bacterial communities in the three regions were significantly different. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria decreased progressively from the alpine to the high-arctic soils, whereas those of Actinobacteria increased. The candidate division AD3 and Acidobacteria abounded in the low Arctic. With respect to the endophytic bacterial communities, plant species and geographic region were the major determinants of the community structures. The plants in the alpine region had higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria, as compared to the plants from the low- and high-arctic regions which were dominated by Firmicutes. A highly conserved shared set of omnipresent bacterial taxa was found to occur in the two plant species, here denoted as the ?tight? core bacteriome. Burkholderiales, Actinomycetales and Rhizobiales were common members of this core, and these taxa were the main contributors to the differences in the endophytic bacterial community structures across compartments as well as regions. We postulate that this tight core is due to selection by the two plants, concomitant with a highly efficient adaptation of such ?core bacteriome? to the plant-associated habitats.','ERP019565','Plants Assemble Species Specific Bacterial Communities From Common Core Taxa in Three Arcto-Alpine Climate Zones','FINISHED','SUBMITTED','mano.joy@gmail.com','Manoj Kumar','2017-01-05 10:42:45.000000','Webin-45234','2017/01/ERP019565','2017-01-05 10:42:45.000000','PRJEB17695',466),(1379,'BGI',NULL,1,NULL,'GD_MGS_describe','ERP020679','GD_MGS_title','FINISHED','SUBMITTED','sun010848@gmail.com','xq sun','2017-01-09 10:28:42.000000','Webin-45726','2017/01/ERP020679','2017-01-09 10:28:42.000000','PRJEB18726',82),(1395,'Graz University of Technology',NULL,1,NULL,'The indigenous phyllosphere microbiome was identified as a key component for plant growth and health, and for positive effects on microbial diversity within a built environment.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the influence of these two parameters on the bacterial communities of raw pork sausages using a metagenomic approach and to correlate these data with sensory analysis.  Two concentrations of sodium chloride were tested: normal content (2 % w/w) vs. a 25 % reduction (1.5 % w/w) and for each, packaging was either vacuum or modified atmosphere (N2%-CO2%). Sausages were stored at 8 °C during 21 days until their use-by date. Spoilage assessment was performed by sensory and physicochemical analyses. To characterize the bacterial diversity, the 16S rDNA of five replicates per condition tested was amplified for pyrosequencing at a scale of 15,000 reads per library. Reads were then clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU).  Spoilage was characterized by an important greying of the products and a production of gas and off-odours defined as rancid, sulphurous and sour. It was more pronounced for samples under modified atmosphere and easier to be ascertained with the lowest salt content. The 20 samples taken altogether,provided 387,111 bacterial 16S rRNA sequences which were analyzed and binned into 78 OTUs (97% threshold).. Packaging atmosphere influenced the average bacterial richness with 69 OTUs (+/-?) identified in vacuum-packed meat and a lower diversity of 46 OTUs (+/-?)in modified atmosphere-packed meat. The richness was influenced mainly in the sub-dominant population whereas the core dominant bacterial species were similar in all samples and composed of Lactobacillus sakei, Lactococcus piscium, Carnobacterium divergens, Serratia proteamaculans and Brochothrix thermosphacta. However, salt reduction turned out to induce a significant drop in species diversity evenness among the core dominant species and thus led to a faster spoilage event..

We sought to describe the overall bacterial diversity on the surface of tomato fruit and the effect of two different water sources (ground and surface water) when used for direct crop applications by generating a 454-pyrosequencing 16S rRNA dataset of these different environments. This study represents the first in depth characterization of bacterial communities in the tomato phyllosphere and the water sources commonly used in commercial vegetable production.    The two water sources tested had a significantly different bacterial composition. Proteobacteria was predominant in groundwater samples, whereas in the significantly more diverse surface water, abundant phyla also included Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The phyllosphere bacterial communities on tomatoes sprayed with both water sources could not be differentiated using various statistical methods. Both phyllosphere environments had a high representation of Gammaproteobacteria, and within this class the genera Pantoea and Enterobacter were the most abundant.    Despite the major differences observed in the bacterial composition of ground and surface water, the season long use of these very different water sources did not have a significant impact on the bacterial composition of the tomato phyllosphere.

As synthetic garments may impact negatively on the skin microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon procedures to define bacterial skin communities at sebaceous and moist body sites of five healthy male volunteers undergoing SkinSuit evaluation. Each volunteer displayed a diverse, distinct bacterial population at each skin site. Short (8 h) periods of dry hyper-buoyancy flotation wearing either gym kit or SkinSuit elicited changes in the composition of the skin microbiota at the genus level but had little or no impact on community structure at the phylum level or the richness and diversity of the bacterial population. We also determined the composition of the skin microbiota of an astronaut during pre-flight training, during an eight-day visit to the International Space Station involving two 8 h periods of SkinSuit wear, and for one month after return. Changes in composition of bacterial skin communities at five body sites were strongly linked to changes in geographical location. A distinct ISS microbiome signature was found which reversed to a pre-flight profile on return. No changes in microbiome complexity or diversity were noted, with little evidence for colonisation by potentially pathogenic bacteria.

The skin microbiome is thought to play important roles in skin defence and immune functioning.  Diabetes affects the skin environment, and this may perturb skin microbiome with possible implications for skin infections and wound healing.  This study examines the skin and wound microbiome in type II diabetes. Results: Ten type II diabetic subjects with chronic foot ulcers were followed over a time course of 10 weeks, sampling from both foot skin (swabs) and wounds (swabs and debrided tissue) every two weeks. A control group of 8 non-diabetic subjects was also followed over 10 weeks, and skin swabs collected from the foot skin every two weeks.  The diabetic skin microbiome was significantly less diverse than non-diabetic skin.  Community composition was also significantly different between diabetic and non-diabetic skin, however the most abundant taxa were similar between groups, with differences driven by very low abundant members of the skin communities. Chronic wounds were generally colonized by the most dominant skin Staphylococcus, along with other taxa that generally different by patient. No significant correlations were found between wound duration or healing status and the abundance of any particular taxa, while wound size was positively correlated with the dominant skin Staphylococcus.   Conclusions: The major difference observed in this study of the skin microbiome associated with diabetes was a significant reduction in diversity.
